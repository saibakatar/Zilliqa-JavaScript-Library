## Introduction

`zilliqa-js` is structured as a Lerna monorepo. Each package roughly
corresponds to a discrete `ZilliqaModule`, most of which can be used
independently.

The only required package is `@zilliqa-js/core`, which contains
the default `HTTPProvider`, and other core abstractions that are necessary for
other modules to function.

The following table provides a description of each module and what you may
want to use it for.

| package                  | description                                                                                                                                                               | dependencies                                                                            |

## Installation

It is recommended that developers install the JavaScript client by making use
of the umbrella package `@zilliqa-js/zilliqa`. This takes care of bootstrapping the various modules, which are then accessible as members of the
`Zilliqa` class.

```shell
yarn add @zilliqa-js/zilliqa
# you may also need to install the tslib package.
yarn add tslib
# bn.js should be added with the above package. if it is not, install it manually.
yarn add bn.js
```

## Quick Start

>**Ideally, you should [Create a new Nucleus Wallet](https://dev-wallet.zilliqa.com/generate) (an [open source](https://github.com/Zilliqa/nucleus-wallet) Zilliqa testnet wallet)**.
>
>You should 'fund' the wallet by sending testnet ZIL tokens from the [ZIL faucet](https://dev-wallet.zilliqa.com/faucet)
>
>You should then replace the value of `const privateKey` with the one from this wallet.
>
>The code should work with the existing private key but this cannot be guaranteed.


```javascript
const { BN, Long, bytes, units } = require("@zilliqa-js/util");
const { Zilliqa } = require("@zilliqa-js/zilliqa");
const { toBech32Address, getAddressFromPrivateKey} = require("@zilliqa-js/crypto");

const zilliqa = new Zilliqa("https://dev-api.zilliqa.com");

// These are set by the core protocol, and may vary per-chain.
// You can manually pack the bytes according to chain id and msg version.
// For more information: https://apidocs.zilliqa.com/?shell#getnetworkid

const chainId = 333; // chainId of the developer testnet
const msgVersion = 1; // current msgVersion
const VERSION = bytes.pack(chainId, msgVersion);

### Notes on the Quick Start script

#### Note 1: Account balance

The account balance is an object with two fields, `balance` and `nonce`. 

`balance` is the account balance in Qa, which is the lowest denomination in Zilliqa. 
For more information about gas accounting, please refer to here: https://forum.zilliqa.com/t/gas-accounting-in-zilliqa/199

`nonce` is a counter that keeps track of how many transactions are sent from a given address. In Zilliqa, every transaction sent from an address must have a unique nonce.

```json
{ "balance": "296505000000000", "nonce": "3" }
```

#### Note 2: Retrieving transaction receipt

An example of a transaction receipt is this:
```json
{
    "cumulative_gas": 357,
    "epoch_num": "676201",
    "event_logs": [
        {
            "_eventname": "setHello()",
            "address": "0x7a4aa130650396ab7c4006c471576a8404f5092b",
            "params": [
                {
                    "type": "Int32",
                    "value": "2",
                    "vname": "code"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```

`event_logs` comprises of all the events emitted in the transaction. For example, if your transaction calls a transition which emits 3 events, it will be an array of three events. The `address` is the contract address of the contract which emits the event.

`success` indicates if the transaction is successful.

## Development

This repository makes use of several technologies to provide a better and
faster development experience for contributors, and has to be bootstrapped
before one can do productive work.

### Bootstrapping

`zilliqa-js` leverages Project References, which is available in TypeScript
from version `3.x`. As such, the build process is slightly different.

```shell
# install all dependencies and shared devDependencies
yarn install

# symlink packages, compile TS source files, and generate protobuf files.
yarn bootstrap

# watch TS source files and recompile on change
yarn build:ts -w
```
### Tests

#### Unit Test

Tests for each package reside in `packages/src/*/tests`, and are run using
`jest`. Files containing unit tests always have the prefix `*.spec.ts`, while integration/e2e tests have the
prefix `*.ispec.ts`.

In order to run any tests, you must first make sure the source files are
compiled and all dependencies are installed by running `yarn bootstrap`.


#### Integration Test
If you wish to run integration tests, you may do so against a local or remote
Zilliqa testnet. However, note that the public testnet may not always be
caught up to the state-of-the-art, and, therefore, can cause `zilliqa-js` to
behave in unexpected ways.

```shell
# run all unit tests
yarn test

# configure environment variables
# $GENESIS_PRIV_KEY - the private key used to run transaction-related tests
# $GENESIS_ADDRESS - the address for the private key
# HTTP_PROVIDER - the URL of the Zilliqa JSON-RPC server
# MNEMONIC - the seed words of the wallet account used to run transaction-related tests
# CHAIN_ID - the chain ID of the specified network
vim .env

# run all integration tests
yarn test:integration
```

#### Local Test

To test with a local project without publishing it, you can use `yarn link` to create a sym-link to the SDK in development.

```
yarn link [zilliqaJs-projectDir]/packages/zilliqa

# cd to your local project
yarn link @zilliqa-js/zilliqa
```

### Bundling

`zilliqa-js` is bundled using `rollup`. Unfortunately, because `elliptic` is
a major dependency and contains a circular dependency that causes `rollup` to
choke, we also make use of `webpack` to pre-process and thereby eliminate the
problem.

To build the distributable bundles, simple run `yarn bundle`. This will output
two bundles, `*.umd.js` and `*.esm.js`, to `packages/*/dist`. Node.js clients
are pointed to the `umd` bundle, and bundlers are pointed to `esm`.

*NOTE: these bundles are _not_ minified.*
